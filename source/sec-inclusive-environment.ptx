  <title>Inclusive Learning Environment</title>

<p>
    No matter who you are or where you come from, you are welcome in this class and you belong here.   Moreover, in this classroom we will be working in groups for some of the time. It is essential that we all work together to create an environment where everyone is welcome.
</p>
<p>
In this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful.   Our diversity may be reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, and myriad other social identities and life experiences.   The goal of inclusiveness, in a diverse community, encourages and appreciates expressions of different ideas, opinions, and beliefs, so that conversations and interactions that could potentially be divisive turn instead into opportunities for intellectual and personal enrichment.   A dedication to inclusiveness requires respecting what others say, their right to say it, and the thoughtful consideration of others' communication.   Both speaking up and listening are valuable tools for furthering thoughtful, enlightening dialogue.   Respecting one another's individual differences is critical in transforming a collection of diverse individuals into an inclusive, collaborative and excellent learning community.   Our core commitment shapes our core expectation for behavior inside and outside of the classroom.
