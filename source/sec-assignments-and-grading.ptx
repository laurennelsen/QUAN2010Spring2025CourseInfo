    <p>
        Grading and providing feedback on your assignments and activities may take up to a week.  If I need more time, I will let you know when to expect a response.

        <em>Types of Assignments:</em>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <em>MyLab Homework:</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Homework problems will require your understanding of statistical concepts and their application to problem contexts.  You will complete these each week in MyLab Statistics.  The homework assignments will typically be due each week at 11:59pm the weeknight before our class meeting.  (However, I strongly recommend trying to complete the homework before then.)  You should get multiple attempts for MyLab homework problems.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                I will drop the lowest conceptual score from each of the MyLab Homework categories.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                    <em>Quizzes:</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                There will be several quizzes throughout the course.  Each of quizzes will be made up of several objectives.  You need to do the problem(s) corresponding to each objective perfectly to earn full credit for that objective. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                On each of the days specified in the schedule, you will be allowed to re-try certain quizzes/objectives.  This will give you another chance to earn credit for objectives that you missed on your first attempt.  
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                For quizzes you may use a 4x6 inch notecard, a basic, nonprogrammable calculator (no phone) and Excel (if the problem allows it).  
                            </p>

                                During quizzes you may NOT search the internet or use other resources that are not allowed.
                            </p>

                                There will be 3 in-class exams during this course: 2 <q>midterm</q> exams and a final exam.  Questions will require your understanding of statistical concepts and their application to problem contexts.  
                            </p>

                                You will be allowed to use an 8.5x11 inch sheet of notes and a basic, nonprogrammable calculator (no phone) during the exams.  You must show your work and answers must be clearly presented to receive full credit.   (Some problems may also allow the use of Excel.)
                            </p>

    <title>Missed/Late Work</title>

    <p>
        I do not have to allow make-ups or accept late work, but I often consider them according to each student's situation.  I strongly recommend asking me for extensions if you find yourself needing them.  In general, communicating with me earlier rather than later about your situation makes it more likely that we can make some kind of arrangement appropriate to your situation.   Let me know as soon as possible if you are going to miss a quiz or exam.   If you don't notify me in advance of your absence, or if you do not have a valid excuse, you may not be allowed to make up the assignment/assessment, and you may receive a score of zero for that assignment/assessment.

    <title>Attendance</title>

    <p>
        It is the expectation of the College of Business that students will attend all classes. However, specific classroom attendance policies are left to the discretion of the instructors. Students are responsible for knowing the attendance policies of their individual instructors. Business instructors may drop students who do not attend the first class of the semester. This policy allows waitlisted students who do attend the first class to be added to the class. Students registering for classes after the first class must obtain approval from the instructor prior to enrolling in the class.
    </p>
    <p>
Class attendance is an important part of the educational process in this course.  Our class time is valuable, and you’re expected to attend class regularly if you are able (and not sick).  Talk to me if you have concerns about this.  
</p>
<p>
The material builds on itself, so I really don’t want you to fall behind.  If something comes up, such as illness, that prevents you from attending class, then let me know as soon as possible.
