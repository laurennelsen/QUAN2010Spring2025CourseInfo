    <title>Technology Requirements</title>

    <p>
        This course requires the use of a UCCS email account, a computer/laptop, and a reliable internet connection. Review the <url href="https://oit.uccs.edu/services/personal-computing-and-devices/stupurchasing">UCCS Online Technical Requirements</url>  for exact specifications. Communication will be by UCCS email and Canvas. If your UCCS email is not your primary address, consider <url href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-rules-to-automatically-forward-messages-45aa9664-4911-4f96-9663-ece42816d746">forwarding your UCCS email address to another account</url> you check often. All official course information must be sent through your UCCS account or Canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
        (We will be meeting in a computer lab, so it's okay if you don't have a personal computer -- you can use a computer in our classroom.  But you are still expected to check email/Canvas regularly.)
