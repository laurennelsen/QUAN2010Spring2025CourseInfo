  <title>Exam 2 Information</title>

  <p>
   Exam 2 will take place in class on the day listed in the syllabus (<xref ref="sec-course-schedule"/>). 
  </p>


  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The exam will cover Chapters 7(Part 2), 8, 9, and 13 from the textbook, which are Chapters 8-11 in the course notes (<url href="https://laurennelsen.github.io/QUAN2010/QUAN_2010_Notes.html"> Link to course notes </url>)
        
      </p>
      
    </li>


    <li>
      <p>
        You will have 120 minutes for the exam.
      </p>
    </li>

<li>
  <p>
    You may use an 8.5 inch by 11 inch page of notes (front and back), a blank Excel spreadsheet, blank scratch paper, and a scientific (or simpler) calculator.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    You are NOT allowed to use other people's work or search internet sits while taking the test.  If you share you answers and others use them, both you and the students you shared with may receive a zero for the exam and may fail the course.
  </p>
</li>


<li>
  <p>
    Unless otherwise indicated, you must show steps that demonstrate the process you take to get to the final answer.  If you use an Excel formula, provide that formula as part of your answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Credit will be given for not only the final answer, but the work/justification that supports that answer.

  </p>
</li>


<li>
  <p>
    If you have a question during the exam, ask me!  It is much better to ask right away than to stay stuck for a long time.

    <title>Suggestions for Study</title>

    <p>
      Look over all of your class notes and make sure you understand everything we have talked about.  Look back at these chapters/problems in the textbook.  Review the MyLab homework and the quiz problems.  (I do not guarantee that all exam questions will look exactly like one of those problems.)

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For a normal population with a mean equal to 87 and a standard deviation equal to 16, determine the probability of observing a sample mean of 90 or less from a sample of size 15.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        <me>P(\overline{X}\leq 90) = NORM.DIST(90,87,16/SQRT(15),1) \approx 0.7661</me>

        For a population that is left-skewed with a mean of 21 and a standard deviation equal to 15, determine the probability of observing a sample mean of 18 or more from a sample of size 33.

      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        <me>P(\overline{X}\geq 18)=P\left(Z\geq \frac{18-21}{15/\sqrt{33}}\right)\approx 1-P(Z\lt -1.1489)=1-NORM.S.DIST(-1.1489,1)\approx 0.8747</me>

  <p>
    A company wondered if people liked the user interface of their upgraded website.  They survey a random selection of their customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose that for <m>n=45</m> surveyed customers, 32 preferred the new user interface.
  </p>
  </introduction>

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find a <m>95\%</m> confidence interval for the proportion of all the company's customers that prefer the new interface.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        <m>\alpha=1-0.95=0.05</m>, <m>\alpha/2=0.025</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>\overline{p}=\frac{32}{45}\approx 0.7111</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>z_{\alpha/2}=NORM.S.INV(.025+.95)\approx 1.96</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Convidence interval formula:  <m>\overline{p}\pm (z_{\alpha/2})\cdot\left(\sqrt{\frac{\overline{p}(1-\overline{p})}{n}}\right)</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        The confidence interval is approximately:
        <me>.7111\pm (1.96)\left(\sqrt{\frac{.7111(1-.7111)}{45}}\right)\rightarrow \boxed{ (0.5787, 0.8435) }</me>

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose the company claims that at least <m>85\%</m> of all the company's customers prefer the new interface.  Does the confidence interval you found support this claim?  Explain why or why not.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        No, it does not.  We are <m>95\%</m> confident that <m>p</m> is between <m>57.87\%</m> and <m>84.35\%</m>, and <m>85\%</m> is larger than <m>84.35\%</m>.

    A CEO is curious if the proportion of employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than <m>30\%</m>.  They conduct a survey of employees.  Suppose that for <m>n=380</m> surveyed employees, 125 were satisfied with their job.  Use <m>\alpha=0.05</m> and test the hypothesis that the proportion of all employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than <m>30\%</m>.

    </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <p>
      Since the p-value is bigger than <m>\alpha=0.05</m>, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.  So there is <em>not</em> enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than <m>30\%</m>.

    Suppose a student has two possible routes for their commute to school.  Because they never want to be late for class, they want to choose the route that provides a more consistent commute time.

The following table summarizes sample data collected from two different routes.
