    <title>Accommodations/Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</title>

    <p>
        If you are a student with a disability and believe you will need accommodations for this class, it is your responsibility to register with Disability Services and provide them with documentation of your disability. They will work with you to determine what accommodations are appropriate for your situation. To avoid any delay, you should contact <url href="https://disability.uccs.edu/">Disability Services</url> as soon as possible. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations cannot be provided until a Faculty Accommodation Letter has been given to me. Please contact Disability Services for more information: Main Hall, room 324, 719-255-3354 or dservice@uccs.edu.

    <title>Religious Accommodations</title>

    <p>
        If due to religious obligations you plan to request adjustments with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance in this class, please contact me as soon as possible. I will work with you and university counselâ€™s office to ensure a reasonable accommodation is made.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-military">
    <title>Military and Veteran Students</title>

    <p>
        Military students who have the potential to participate in military activities including training and deployment should consult with faculty prior to registration for any course, but no later than the end of the first week of classes. For more information, visit the <url href="https://military.uccs.edu/">Office of Veteran and Military Student Affairs</url>.
</p>
<p>
At this time, the student should provide the instructor with a schedule of planned absences, preferably signed by the student's commander, to allow the instructor to evaluate and advise the student on the possible impact of the absences. In this course, the instructor will consider absences due to participation in verified military activities to be excused absences, on par with those due to other unavoidable circumstances such as illness. If, however, it appears that military obligations will prevent adequate attendance or performance in the course, the instructor may advise the student to register for the course at another time, when they are more likely to be successful.
