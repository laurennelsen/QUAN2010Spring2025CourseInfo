  <title>Exam 1 Information</title>

  <p>
   Exam 1 will take place in class on the day listed in the syllabus (<xref ref="sec-course-schedule"/>). 
  </p>


  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The exam will cover Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7(Part 1) from the textbook, which are Chapters 2-7 in the course notes (<url href="https://laurennelsen.github.io/QUAN2010/QUAN_2010_Notes.html"> Link to course notes </url>)
      
      </p>
      
    </li>


    <li>
      <p>
        You will have 120 minutes for the exam.
      </p>
    </li>

<li>
  <p>
    You may use an 8.5 inch by 11 inch page of notes (front and back), a blank Excel spreadsheet, blank scratch paper, and a scientific (or simpler) calculator.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    You are NOT allowed to use other people's work or search internet sits while taking the test.  If you share you answers and others use them, both you and the students you shared with may receive a zero for the exam and may fail the course.
  </p>
</li>


<li>
  <p>
    Unless otherwise indicated, you must show steps that demonstrate the process you take to get to the final answer.  If you use an Excel formula, provide that formula as part of your answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Credit will be given for not only the final answer, but the work/justification that supports that answer.

  </p>
</li>


<li>
  <p>
    If you have a question during the exam, ask me!  It is much better to ask right away than to stay stuck for a long time.

You will need to do all of your work in Excel and upload the file to Canvas.  (Be sure to give your histogram a title and label your axes.  Also remember to follow all of the best practices for histograms discussed in class and in our textbook.  This means that you should use the <m>2^k\geq n</m> Rule to find the number of bins, and remember to include all of your work and label everything clearly.)

        Assume the average selling price for houses in a certain county is <m>\$ 348,000</m> with a standard deviation of <m>\$ 30,000</m>.

    <p>
      Using Chebyshev's Theorem, determine the range of prices that includes at least <m>91\%</m> of the homes around the mean.  (Using Chebyshev's Theorem, we don't need to assume anything about how the prices are distributed.)

        <me>1-\frac{1}{z^2}=0.91</me>
        <me>1-0.91=\frac{1}{z^2}</me>

      Exercise 7.1.14 from the Course Notes (<url href="https://laurennelsen.github.io/QUAN2010/sec-normal-distribution.html" />)
    </p>
    <p>
      A random variable follows the normal probability distribution with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 6.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What is the probability that a randomly selected value from this population is greater than or equal to 70?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        <m>P(X\geq 70) = 1-NORM.DIST(70,80,6,1)\approx 0.9522</m>

    <answer>
      <p>
        <m>P(\lt 70)=NORM.DIST(70,80,6,1)\approx 0.0478</m>

        What is the probability that a randomly selected value from this population is between 75 and 85?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        <m>P(75\leq X\leq 85)=NORM.DIST(85,80,6,1)-NORM.DIST(75,80,6,1)\approx 0.5953</m>
